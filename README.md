# this year i learned about
a totally inaccurate list of things i learned of every year. the dark figure is very high!

# example command to generate the lists

$ find . -type f -name "*.png" -newermt "20170101" -and -not -newermt "20180101" | sort > ~/tmp/2017.md
```

# update interval
every `31st december` or when i am in the mood to update it.
